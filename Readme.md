## Description :
------------

Garrick: Tales of a Troubadour is a little mod for Baldur’s Gate Trilogy and Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition which aims to make the character of Garrick more interesting to play, adding new dialogues, new situations and encounters as well as additional songs proper to the bard of Beregost. For this reason it is based on the content introduced by BG1NPC and completes it.
I hope that it will let you, reader, appreciate this character who, despite his reputation of useless gullible or baggage carrier, comes with good options of role-play, for who knows how to exploit him.

Sit by the fire, forget the worries of the road, and listen to the tales of the troubador...


## Compatibility :
------------

Please note that Garrick: Tales of a Troubadour requires the componants ["Banters, Quests, and Interjections"](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/BG1NPC/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#the-bg1npc-project-banters-quests-and-interjections) AND from ["Player-Initiated Dialogues (PIDs)"](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/BG1NPC/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#the-bg1npc-project-player-initiated-dialogues-pids) [BG1NPC](https://github.com/Gibberlings3/BG1NPC) mod.
